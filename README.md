## Large File Support

ArchiveSift supports viewing files larger than 10MB. For the best performance with large files:

1. **Memory Management**: When working with very large files, ensure your system has sufficient RAM
2. **Preloading**: Large files are loaded progressively to maintain responsiveness
3. **File Types**: Some large file types (especially large RAW or video files) may take longer to load initially

### Tips for Large Files

- For faster navigation between large files, enable the cache feature in preferences
- Use the "Low Memory Mode" option for very large collections on systems with limited RAM
- Videos and animations over 100MB may benefit from using the external player option
